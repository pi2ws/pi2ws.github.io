*Bridging the gap between digital computation and the physical world through robotics, and artificial intelligence.*

Physical AI represents a groundbreaking frontier where artificial intelligence (AI) integrates with physical systems to interact with and manipulate the real world. This cutting-edge technology drives transformative advancements in robotics, automation, and human-machine collaboration. It powers innovative solutions across diverse sectors, from humanoid robots addressing labor shortages to autonomous systems bolstering defense capabilities. By enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act, physical AI sets new standards for efficiency and adaptability in environments like warehouses and off-road autonomous driving. As it evolves, physical AI is poised to revolutionize industries and redefine human-technology interactions. 

**Date:** November 6-7, 2025

**Location:** University of Delaware, Newark, DE
